For Project 2, you will be working in groups of 4 to build a full-stack Rails application.

Everyone must submit an idea for Project 2, and we encourage each person to pitch at least one idea for the class. 

After hearing the pitches, you'll rank the projects in order of what you would prefer to build. We'll use these preferences to pick the four project ideas and put together the groups.

### Pitch Guidelines

1. Keep it VERY brief (think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch" target="_blank">elevator pitch</a>). Your pitch cannot exceed 3 minutes.


2. Answer these questions:
  * What is your idea?
  * Who is your user, and how does your app make their life better?
  * What technologies would you use that we haven't covered in class (if any)?
  
3. No slides. Use the whiteboard to draw any visuals you need.
